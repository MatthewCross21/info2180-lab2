        <h2>My First Year at UWI</h2>

        <p>The change from high school to university seemed daunting yet exciting. Starting a new chapter of my life but yet I was nowhere ready for it. First came the registering for my courses, which seemed a bit confusing at first especially due to the great functionality of the UWI SAS site. Thankfully, there were students from years before me in the various Whatsapp groups who were more than willing to help out and explain how UWI operates. I eventually set my schedule to how I wanted to after many tries and I was now ready to go. Though my schedule was set I still felt very unprepared, I was not sure what materials I needed to get and on which block my classes were. I also started driving, so now it was my responsibility to get myself to school on time for my classes. The last thing that I wanted was to be that person that is walking into a lecture late, especially on the first day. I spoke to some older friends of mine and they gave me some advice on how to survive university life. </p> 
        <p>Now came the first day, the first day of going to school and getting to choose what I want to wear rather than having to wear uniform. As I got on to the campus, it was time to hit the ground running, everyone frantically rushing around trying to find where their classes were and just taking it all in. It was not too bad though since I had my friends from high school and we were all figuring it out together. The first week was relatively calm as it was mainly just introduction classes but all of that was soon to change during the second week. In my second week in the Faculty of Science and Technology, we got introduced to labs and tutorials which made the schedule feel not as short anymore. Luckily my lab was online but as for my tutorials they were in person. A smaller class setting with a tutorial teacher and much more of a chance on getting called on to answer a question, really fun stuff.  </p>

        <h2>My Expectations for Second Year and How it's going</h2>

        <p>Here it is, the second year of a Computer Science major. Many before me have told me how terrifying year 2 will be and I have just been brushing it off and it is finally here. Specifically, semester 1 with the likes of Discrete Mathematics and Net-Centric that have high failure rates in this faculty. I know the spots for classes would full up quickly so I registered as early as possible. This was probably the best thing I could have done since the courses ended up being over-subscribed and I would have to be running around trying to get overrides so that I can attend classes. Luckily I was all set for the most part, I was still anxious for the courses to come especially Discrete Mathematics as I was not the best at math in high school. Seeing as it is a prerequisite for a lot of the third year courses I have to do my best so that I will be able to move on. </p>
        <p>Classes have been going on for about 5 weeks now and I resonate with the stories from those before me.  It has only been a little over a month and I am already lost in most of my courses. Now mid-semesters are coming and I really need to buckle down and learn all of the content. It is like you zone out for 5 minutes in a lecture and all of a sudden you are lost for the rest of the weeks and the weeks to come. All this content is being pushed and in such a short amount of time.</p>
